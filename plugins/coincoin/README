            LibPurple's CoinCoin Plugin
            ***************************

1. What is Coincoin?

This is a plugin for the purple library, which allow to connect to a DaCode
board, to read and send messages on it.

The default board used by prpl-coincoin is linuxfr.org/board, which popularized
this kind of chat among a few french communities.

Other softwares support this kind of board, like Templeet or Da Portative
Bouchot.

You can find a (non-exhaustive) list of boards on this page (look at the
"tribune" links):

A board has an unique chat space, so prpl-coincoin creates at connection an
unique channel "board".

2. How to install it

Compile prpl-coincoin and copy the libcoincoin.so file to /usr/lib/purple-2/.

Then, use your favorite purple client (for example MinBif), and the module is
automatically loaded.

3. How to use it

Create a new account, and select the "CoinCoin" plugin. Then, you need to give
this settings:

* Username: your login[@server] on board (if the @server part is not given,
            defauts to linuxfr.org board)
* Password: locate your cookies for the website (from your browser), and put
            them here, separated by semi-colons (;)

Full example for a custom Da Portative Bouchot board:
	/MAP ADD coincoin ToTo@tribioune.mydomain.tld
	     md5=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx;unique_id=yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
	     -board /remote.xml -post /index.php/add

4. You're connected

he *status* channel is always created in minbif, but always empty for coincoin
accounts, as this system as no presence information.

The *board* channel is automatically created, and you can chat!

Have fun.

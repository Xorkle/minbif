in inetd with this command:
.nf
# update-inetd --add '56667 stream tcp nowait minbif /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/bin/minbif /etc/minbif/minbif.conf'
.fi

.SH HOW TO USE
Connect your IRC client (for examble \fIirssi\fP) on minbif with this command:
.nf
/server localhost 56667 \fIpassword\fP
.fi

The nickname set on your IRC client is your username on minbif. First time you
connect to minbif with this nickname, the account is created and the
\fIpassword\fP parameter is set.

Next, use the \fB/map help\fP command to know how to add a network.
